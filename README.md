# Building a To Do list with React and Redux

Your task is to create a simple to do list app written in React with Redux as a state store.


You can structure your app however you like but try to include all the basic requirements below. 


At the moment, we have set this app for you with basic scripts, Redux and Redux dev tools.


 We have implemented some logic to change the Greeting when you type in your name. This is just to show you some code examples of using Redux in React. Study the code before you start the task and make sure you understand how it works. You may keep the greeting input if you want, or remove it, it's up to you.

# Installation :wrench:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app. :rocket:
